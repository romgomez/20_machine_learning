# Exoplanet Exploration

![exoplanets.jpg](Images/exoplanets.jpg)

## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, you will create machine learning models capable of classifying whether a record is a candidate exoplanet from the dataset of observed objects.

In this homework assignment, you will need to:

1. [Preprocess the raw data](#Preprocessing)
2. [Tune the models](#Tune-Model-Parameters)
3. [Compare two or more models](#Evaluate-Model-Performance)

## Instructions

### Preprocess the Data

* Preprocess the raw dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features. The dataset includes 50 columns-- how many will be sufficient for a healthy model?
* Use `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separate the data into training and testing data.

### Tune Model Parameters

* Use `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Tune and compare at least two different classifiers. Three is recommended.

### Evaluate Model Performance

Compare the performance of your tuned classifiers to determine the best-performing model.
